In fields of gold, the sun's warm embrace,
Dances on flowers, a gentle grace.
Laughter echoes in the breeze,
Underneath the whispering trees.

Butterflies flit in joyful flight,
Painting rainbows in the light.
Smiles bloom like flowers in spring,
As hearts together joyously sing.

In this world of endless cheer,
Where love and happiness draw near,
Let every moment brightly shine,
In this happy, joyful rhyme.
